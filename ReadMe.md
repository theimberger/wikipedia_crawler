## About
Wikipedia Crawler is a bot which finds a path between two pages on Wikipedia as given by a user.
This path is created by selecting sequential links on each page.  The path is then visualized as a node tree.

### Todos
Select the shortest path by first getting a path and then re-running the set of pages with the found path as a limit.
If a shorter path is found it's returned and then the crawl is run again until the shortest path is found.
