# Wikipedia Crawler

## Background
Wikipedia crawler is a automation of a game I used to play in high school in which students were given two links on Wikipedia and "raced" to connect them via a series of link traversals.  For the purpose of this data visualization the following functionalities will be considered the requirements for a minimum viable product.

##MVPs

- [ ] Users must be able to specify end and start points of the crawl
- [ ] The route should appear as a series of nodes representing connecting links
- [ ] The automatic process should be visualized live
- [ ] Each link added as it is queried

Additionally
- [ ] There should be an introductory modal to explain the purpose of the app to the user
- [ ] A production style ReadMe
